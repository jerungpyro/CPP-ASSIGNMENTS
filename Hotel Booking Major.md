This coding is from my Test 1 where the requirement is ask the user to enter the Customer's name, room code, number of days and payment method. 
Customers can choose to pay using a credit card or cash.
Calculate the total price need to be paid by the customer including an additional 6% for the government tax. 
If the customer chooses to pay with a credit card, a 10% discount will be given to the total price.
The program then displays the total bill that needs to be paid by the customer
